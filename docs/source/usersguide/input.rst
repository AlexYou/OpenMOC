Geometry Specification

The geometry in OpenMOC is described using constructive solid geometry (CSG),
also sometimes referred to as combinatorial geometry. CSG allows a user to
create complex objects using Boolean operators on a set of simpler surfaces. In
the geometry model, each unique closed volume in defined by its bounding
surfaces. In OpenMC, most quadratic surfaces can be modeled and used as
bounding surfaces.

OpenMOC Neutral Particle Transport Code
==========================================

Welcome to the OpenMOC repository! OpenMOC is a simulation tool for 
solving for the flux, power distribution, and multiplication factor 
within a nuclear reactor. The code employs the deterministic method 
of characteristics using fixed source iteration. The OpenMOC project 
project aims to provide a simple-to-use Python package bound to a 
back-end of source code written in C/C+ and CUDA. It includes support 
for constructive solid geometry and 2D ray tracing for fully 
heterogeneous multi-group calculations. Development of OpenMOC began 
at MIT in 2012 and is spearheaded by several graduate students in the 
`Nuclear Science & Engineering Department`_.

Complete documentation on the usage of OpenMOC is hosted at 
https://mit-crpg.github.io/OpenMOC/. If you plan to use OpenMOC 
frequently and would like to contribute to the project, please 
`contact`_ the development team.
